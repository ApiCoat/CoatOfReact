It includes Page Routing, i18next Localization(EN-DE-NL), Helmet, Bootstrap, jQuery and all of them are working great.

Please do contribute to complete this work and carry this out of its scope. It is getting really great day by day :)

I am still working on the webpage, but it gives you an idea about this project.

Why it named like "Coat of React"?
We normally uses "Coat of arms of the City of London" or "Royal coat of arms of the United Kingdom" to target a logo design for defining a real place. The idea is same.

Coat of React = Defines a real place of React
